"""https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/pickle.html


The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing 
and de-serializing a Python object structure. 

“Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is 
converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse 
operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like 
object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. 

Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, 
“marshalling,” [1] or “flattening”; however, to avoid confusion, 
the terms used here  are “pickling” and “unpickling”.
